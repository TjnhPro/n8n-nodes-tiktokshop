# fulfillments-service Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-fulfillment-packages-support. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: FulfillmentsService extends BaseService
FulfillmentsService MUST inherit from BaseService so it reuses shared signing, proxy, and access token behavior.

#### Scenario: FulfillmentsService constructor delegates to BaseService
- **GIVEN** FulfillmentsService is instantiated with credentials and optional proxy configuration
- **WHEN** it is created
- **THEN** it calls `super` with the provided credentials and proxy options so outbound calls reuse BaseService request helpers.

### Requirement: FulfillmentsService ships packages
FulfillmentsService MUST call the TikTok Ship Package endpoint with the required path, method, headers, query, and JSON payload.

#### Scenario: Ship package request uses POST with JSON body
- **GIVEN** `shipPackage` receives `packageId`, `appKey`, `appSecret`, `shopCipher`, signing fields, optional `accessToken`, and a JSON body payload
- **WHEN** it dispatches the request
- **THEN** it issues an HTTP `POST` to `/fulfillment/202309/packages/{packageId}/ship`
- **AND** it sets headers `content-type: application/json` and `x-tts-access-token` when an access token is provided
- **AND** the query string includes `app_key`, `timestamp`, `sign`, and `shop_cipher={shopCipher}`
- **AND** it forwards the provided JSON body unchanged.

### Requirement: FulfillmentsService retrieves package documents
FulfillmentsService MUST call the TikTok Get Package Shipping Document endpoint and accept any TikTok-supported document type.

#### Scenario: Get shipping documents request uses GET with document type query
- **GIVEN** `getPackageShippingDocument` receives `packageId`, `documentType`, and required signing parameters
- **WHEN** it dispatches the request
- **THEN** it issues an HTTP `GET` to `/fulfillment/202309/packages/{packageId}/shipping_documents`
- **AND** the query string includes `app_key`, `timestamp`, `sign`, `shop_cipher`, and `document_type` when provided
- **AND** `document_type` accepts TikTok values `SHIPPING_LABEL`, `PACKING_SLIP`, `SHIPPING_LABEL_AND_PACKING_SLIP`, `SHIPPING_LABEL_PICTURE`, `HAZMAT_LABEL`, and `INVOICE_LABEL`.

### Requirement: FulfillmentsService creates packages
FulfillmentsService MUST call the TikTok Create Packages endpoint using POST with a JSON payload.

#### Scenario: Create packages request posts JSON body
- **GIVEN** `createPackages` receives credential inputs, `shopCipher`, and a JSON body describing packages
- **WHEN** it dispatches the request
- **THEN** it issues an HTTP `POST` to `/fulfillment/202309/packages`
- **AND** it sets headers `content-type: application/json` and `x-tts-access-token` when an access token is present
- **AND** the query string includes `app_key`, `timestamp`, `sign`, and `shop_cipher`
- **AND** the outbound body is the provided JSON payload.
